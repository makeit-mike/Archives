find line-line intersection

    Solve for intersection point of x.
    x + 2 = -x + 5
    x = -x + 3
    2x = 3
    x = 3/2

    Solve for intersection point of y.
    l1 = y = x + 2
         y - 2 = x 
    l2 = y = -x + 5 
        -x = y - 5
         x = -y + 5

    y - 2 = -y + 5
    y = -y + 7
    2y = 7
    y = 7/2 

    two line segments must intersect at (3/2, 7/2)
