# cppArchives

An archive of random work I am practicing and doing in CPP.

I will avoid adding any of my openGL or sfml work here, as those frameworks lend more towards game dev, and this is to be a simple reference when I need to practice more leet-code and interview questions.

If you see anything I am doing abhorently wrong, please let me know!
As of writing this, I spend almost all of my professional time in C# and t-SQL, so sometimes they intermingle with my C++ ability.
