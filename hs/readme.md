# Haskell Archives

## A collection of code challenges and learning lessons in one source.

Examples/Learning will mainly be a combination of the following:
- Learn You a Haskell 
- Code Confrences
- Youtube lessons (ex. Code Report, Category Theory lectures, etc)
- Readings found across many sources. Namely Functional Programming articles, Stack Overflow, Mathematical literature, LYAH.

Algorithms/Code Challenges will come mainly from the following:
- Code Wars (one of the few Challenge websites with Haskell support (and provides unit tests)
- LeetCode (does not support Haskell, but I still enjoy using their platform due to how they set up questions)
- Other excersizes found in lectures, books.

## Project examples

Full fledged examples on how real world programs in Haskell will be stored in examples/projects/  
A more indepth roadmap and readme will be stored in this directory.

Examples include:  
- Parsing JSON
- Making SQL Calls
- Effective IO
- Web Frameworks & RESTful APIs
- More?
