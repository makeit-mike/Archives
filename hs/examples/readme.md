<h1>These examples mainly come from LearnYouAHaskell</h1>

If you are just starting out with Haskell, this repo can help just for seeing code in use, but for actual learning, it is recommended to follow through with the book.

All code credit in these examples are my interpretations from LYAH, some may be the exact same, others will be truncated or expanded upon... depending on my own expertise in a given subject
